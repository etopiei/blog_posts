<p> Ever since I watched the WWDC last week I have been very excited to test drive macOS Mojave and most importantly dark mode! :O However I had an iOS app assessment and I didn't want to mess anything up with the beta of Xcode, or a new operating system, so my plan was on hold for a couple of days. <br><br> Eventually the day came, and as soon as I was done with my assessment I rushed back home to install the beta. After an hour or so of waiting for it to install I was in. The first thing I noticed was the larger icon on the login screen, after entering my password I was greeted by the beautiful Mojave wallpaper and prompted to select either Light or Dark mode. I didn't hesitate to choose dark mode, and overall have greatly enjoyed the UI overhaul this update brings to the Mac Operating System. <br><br> <img src="/img/mac3.jpg" width="80%"> <br>My experience thus far has been very nice, things are pretty clean and look really beautiful in Mojave, with a few slight exceptions. <br> I found that while I enjoyed the new look it was at times inconcistent and a bit unpolished. The volume UI is a weird mix of dark mode and light, as well as many apps were unsure as to their colour scheme. In terms of the user experience I have been pleasantly surprised at the relatively smooth experience the beta software provided. I've had a few crashes, and some apps are much more troublesome than others, but overall apps continue to run smoothly and I havem't noticed too many glaring bugs. A couple of problems with the new Finder view was the only thing I could find wanting on Apple's end. All in all I'm very impressed with the quality of this OS upgrade and commend Apple for their work. I look forward to continuing to test drive macOS Mojave over the coming weeks to get a better feel for it, and enjoy it, as more apps begin to suit the system. <br>Until next time, I'll sign off, stay tuned for more blog posts in the near future. <br><br> - etopiei (15/6/18)
