This year I once again participated in UniHack, this has been a wonderful experience for me in previous years (<a href="http://blog.etopiei.xyz/index.php?id=25">2018</a>, <a href="http://blog.etopiei.xyz/index.php?id=19">2017</a>) and I was really looking forward to competing again. This year our teams idea was to create an app which would help people have safer commutes on public transport. This is a particularly important issue right now as many people feel unsafe in the city espcially at night. It was really great to tackle a large social problem at UniHack and definitely different to most other projects I had undertaken. <br><br> For this project I largely worked on the server, which communicated with the routing system and the queried the data we had gathered to return to the Front-End app information about where they want to go, and which routes pose which dangers. This was a lot of fun, and while I struggled at times working with promises in node requests and waiting for query results the result was a fairly clean interface for the front-end to get any information it needed. <br><br> While we didn't win any prizes this year I was pleased with what we managed to create, as for the large part we were able to create a working prototype, and it was really valuable experience. <br><br> Aside from the actual competition, meeting really cool people from different organisations and universities was another highlight and I really appreciate all the work of the UniHack team and partner organisations to make this year a great success. <br><br> If you'd like to check out the code go here: <a href="https://github.com/etopiei/lumino">Code</a><br> Also check out our devpost here: <a href="https://devpost.com/software/lumino">DevPost</a><br><br>That's all for now, catch you guys soon.<br><br> - etopiei (3/5/2019)
