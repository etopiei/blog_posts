<p class="blog-text" id="contents">This week I will be doing the live below the line challenge. The aim of this challenge is to live on $2 per day for a week. I am completing the challenge with a group of friends so we are sharing food resources to make it easier. <br> I begun my adventure today with 3 pancakes, which I scoffed down before heading off to my java class. Upon return I made quick use of the coffee we had bought to wake myself up. My first blunder came mere hours into the challenge as I mistakenly ate a muesli bar while writing my maths assignment, believing I had two muesli bars for today, only to discover that I had only two for the week. :O Muesli bar blunder aside though the challenge is going quite well, thus far I am only experiencing minor hunger however I'd be lying if I said I hadn't thought about lunch quite a few times already today. <br> I will keep you posted as this challenge continue, but until then I'll sign off and head back to eat some lunch. <br> P.S.
