<p class="blog-text" id="contents">Work hard in silence, let success make the noise.<br>When I first heard this quote it really resonated with me and ever since I have remembered it and reflected on it. I truly do believe it is something, when applied to your life that can have a significant positive impact. <br>A while ago I read an article that explained that psychologically, telling someone your plans to go to the gym more regularly or to go on a run tomorrow gives your brain the same sensation as actually doing this activity, which often leads to then not fulfilling whatever it is you set out to achieve. Obviously, this is not an ideal system, so what is the solution?<br>I believe the solution lies in the quote from the beginning of this post, don't tell people your plans when it is something you are doing for yourself, because chances are, doing it for yourself in silence will be much more rewarding and effective than sharing your goals before you have accomplished them. <br>I have two small notes to add to this though, 1; there is a certain person you should tell, and this is someone who will push you and truly keep you accountable for your words. You know these people in your life and these are good people to share your goals with should you want to be successful. Secondly, the benefits of this approach are two-fold. You are more likely to do whatever it is you have set out to do, but also you are very deliberately doing it for yourself.<br>In the modern world we live in, there are so many demands on your time, money and responsibilities from a large variety of people. You do work for your boss, you are constantly receiving notifications from your friends, vying for your time. Therefore taking some time out from this world, taking a step back and doing something purely for your own benefit and enjoyment can be quite a revelation. We all have things we want to learn and do, whether it be taking some time to learn to draw, or going for a swim, but too often we talk about these things instead of going out and getting them done.<br>So, I would encourage you greatly, as I too challenge myself to go out and do something for yourself, that you've wanted to do for a while, maybe something that you tell people you are going to do sometimes, and just do it (Nike, oops.). For there is great satisfaction to be found in working in silence, let your actions speak for you and improve yourself in the process. Because truly nothing speaks louder than success and contentment in yourself and your achievements. <br><br>- etopiei (25/6/17)</p>
